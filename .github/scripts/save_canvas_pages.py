"""
Fetch canvas iframe pages from the running dev server, save them as clean
static HTML files, and patch the gallery snapshot HTML to reference them.

Why this script exists
----------------------
The gallery's component detail pages embed live canvas pages in iframes using
URLs like ``/_canvas/?component=demo_components__button&mode=basic``.  These
cannot be saved by wget because the ``?`` character is illegal in artifact
upload paths.  The canvas pages also contain absolute ``/static/…`` paths that
break when the snapshot is deployed inside a sub-directory (``/demo/``) on
GitHub Pages.

Additionally, because wget is told to exclude ``/_canvas/`` from its crawl,
any static assets that are *only* referenced from canvas pages (e.g.
``canvas.css``, per-component CSS/JS) would never be downloaded.  This script
fetches those too.

This script:
1. Scans all downloaded HTML files for canvas iframe ``src`` attributes.
2. Fetches every unique canvas URL from the still-running local server.
3. Collects all ``/static/…`` references from each canvas page and fetches
   any that aren't already present in the snapshot's ``static/`` directory.
4. Rewrites ``/static/`` → ``../static/`` inside each fetched canvas page.
5. Saves each page as ``_canvas/<component>__<params>.html`` (see
   ``make_clean_name``).
6. Patches every gallery HTML file to replace the absolute ``/_canvas/?…``
   src with a relative path to the newly saved clean file.

Usage

    python3 save_canvas_pages.py <snapshot_dir> <base_url>

    snapshot_dir  – root of the wget mirror, e.g. gallery-snapshot/localhost:8000
    base_url      – running server root, e.g. http://localhost:8000
